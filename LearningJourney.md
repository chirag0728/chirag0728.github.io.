# Chirag's Cybersecurity Learning Journey

Hey there! I'm Chirag, and welcome to my cybersecurity journey. I'm a security researcher who loves offensive security, and this blog is my way of sharing the challenges, wins, and insights I pick up along the way.

## üìå Goals
- **Master Offensive Security**: I want to become an expert in offensive security techniques, like penetration testing, exploitation, and advanced attack methods.
- **Certifications**: I'm working on getting certifications like OSCP, OSEP, and OSED to validate my skills and take my understanding to the next level.
- **Community Contribution**: I want to give back by sharing what I learn, documenting my research, and creating resources for others.

## üöÄ Journey Highlights
- **Practical Projects**: I share my work on projects involving offensive security, network analysis, and software vulnerabilities.
- **Research and Notes**: I've been diving into different CVEs, learning how they work, and sharing my findings here.
- **Capture The Flag (CTF)**: CTFs are a big part of my learning. I participate in them and post write-ups to share what I've learned and my approach.

## üîç What You'll Find Here
- **Step-by-Step Guides**: Tutorials and breakdowns of the cybersecurity topics I'm exploring.
- **Write-Ups and Reflections**: Weekly summaries of my work, research, and what I've learned.
- **Personal Insights**: My thoughts on solving tough security problems and the mindset needed for offensive security.

## üå± My Approach to Learning
I'm all about hands-on practice. I break down complex topics, experiment with projects, and connect different pieces of knowledge to really understand how things work. This journey isn't just about collecting information‚Äîit's about building real skills that can be used in the real world.
