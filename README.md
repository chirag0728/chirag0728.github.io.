# Chirag's Cybersecurity Learning Journey

Welcome to **Chirag's Blog**, my personal space where I dive into the fascinating world of cybersecurity! Here, I share my journey in offensive security—covering the insights, challenges, and discoveries that come along the way.

## About the Blog

I started this blog to keep track of my progress in mastering cybersecurity and to give an honest, inside look at what it's like to learn offensive security techniques. My goal is to break down complex cybersecurity ideas into manageable pieces and share my research, exploits, and thought processes with others interested in the field.

You'll find a mix of:
- **Learning Summaries**: Key takeaways from books, courses, and hands-on labs.
- **Walkthroughs and Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides to solving specific problems or explaining technical concepts.
- **Research Notes**: In-depth explorations into vulnerabilities, protocols, and new discoveries.
- **Project Updates**: A look into the projects I'm working on, both personal and collaborative.

Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced practitioner, I hope you’ll find something here that resonates with you or helps you on your journey.

## Structure
- **Topics Covered**: Command injection, packet processing, TLS mechanics, exploitation techniques, filter evasion, and more.
- **Weekly Write-Ups**: Daily reflections compiled into weekly summaries of progress, challenges, and new lessons.
- **Research Corner**: Insights into CVEs, offensive security methods, and ongoing project documentation.

## My Approach
For me, learning works best when it’s driven by curiosity and kept straightforward. Here’s how I go about it:

1. **Hands-On Practice**: I believe in learning by doing—cybersecurity is all about getting your hands dirty. I spend time experimenting with labs, tools, and real scenarios. There’s no better way to learn than to try, fail, and figure things out.

2. **Breaking Down Complexity**: Offensive security often deals with complex problems, so I break them down into smaller, manageable parts. Documenting each step helps me understand both the “how” and the “why” of a technique.

3. **Networked Knowledge**: I use a method inspired by **Zettelkasten** to keep my notes interconnected. Cybersecurity concepts are rarely isolated, so linking them helps me understand how everything fits together.

4. **Daily Reflection**: I take time every day to reflect on what I’ve learned, the challenges I’ve faced, and areas for improvement. These reflections are what make up my weekly write-ups, helping me stay on track and continuously refine my approach.

5. **Minimalist Documentation**: I aim for straightforward, minimal documentation. My notes are concise but packed with information, making it easy for me—and hopefully others—to revisit and grasp key ideas quickly.
