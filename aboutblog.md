# About This Blog

Hey there! I'm Chirag, and welcome to my blog. This is where I document my journey through the ever-changing world of cybersecurity. Here, I share everything I'm learning as I dive deeper into offensive security, packet analysis, and network protocols. My goal is to break down complex cybersecurity topics, share my experiments, and hopefully give back to the community that's helped me so much.

I started this blog to keep track of my progress, tackle difficult topics, and share solutions to challenges I've faced. You'll find vulnerability write-ups, projects I've worked on, research findings, and my thoughts on the latest trends in cybersecurity.

As a recent graduate from Arizona State University and a security researcher at RTX BBN, I want to make these topics as approachable as possible—whether you're just starting out or you're already deep into the field. I'm also planning to take certifications like OSCP, OSEP, and OSED to deepen my skills and share my experiences here.

Whether you're here to learn, explore, or just get a different perspective on digital security, I hope this blog is a helpful resource for you. Feel free to reach out if you have questions, ideas, or if you'd like to collaborate—I'd love to connect with others who are as passionate about making technology more secure as I am.

I'm planning to add a few visuals soon to make these concepts even clearer. Stay tuned!
